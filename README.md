# ðŸ”’ MCP Server Authentication Reference Collection

Reference servers that demo how authentication works with the current [Model Context Protocol spec](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/).

>[!WARNING]
>Code presented here is for **demo purposes only**. Your specific scenarios (including rules inside your enterprise, specific security controls, or other protection mechanisms) may differ from the ones that are outlined in this repository. **Always** conduct a security audit and threat modeling for any production and customer-facing assets that require authentication and authorization.

## Scenarios
